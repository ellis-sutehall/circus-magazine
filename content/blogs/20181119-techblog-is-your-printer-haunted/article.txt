We all know how annoying printers can be. They refuse to print, jam themselves up with paper, and spew out thousands of copies of embarrassing personal documents that you didn’t want printed in the first place.

But why do they do it? Are they just dicks? Or is printing such an inherently complicated business that all of human ingenuity has so far failed to come up with a printer that reliably does the one thing it is supposed to do?

No. According to new findings from the Church Of England’s Paranormal Research Group the most common cause of malfunction in printers is supernatural in origin. The group tested over a thousand printers and discovered that almost 40% of them are haunted.

Needless to say that the tormented souls of the departed can play havoc with electronic equipment, and especially with printers. So what can you do if you think your printer might be haunted? Often simple remedies such as placing a bottle of holy water on the printer or saying a brief prayer (the patron saint of printers is St John Boscoe) before hitting ‘Print’ can do the trick. If problems persist, get in touch with your local church and arrange to have the printer blessed.

In some cases, though, your printer may require exorcising, in which case you should call the professionals. For example, if, when you try to print out your spreadsheet, your printer makes and ugly gurgling sound and instead vomits forth countless pages of Latin text and occult symbols, it is almost certainly possessed. You should call a priest immediately and not use the printer again until he arrives. Do not be alarmed if the printer smells strongly of sulphur. This is quite normal.
