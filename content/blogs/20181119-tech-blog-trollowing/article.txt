The history of computing is littered with the names of maverick individuals. Alan Turing, Tim Berners Lee, that bald bloke with the attitude problem who made that shit car/bike thing, the list is an impressive one — and I believe that my name will shortly join theirs in the IT hall of fame. This may seem a bold prediction, but you will see that it is more than justified, for today I invented ‘Trollowing’.

The premise is quite simple: I just log in to the social network Twitter, and start ‘following’ as many odious public figures as I can be bothered to look up. Then — and here’s the twist — instead of showering them with praise and sycophancy, as Twitter users are wont to do, I mercilessly insult or ‘troll’ them: hence ‘Trollowing’.

Let me give you an example. So far today I have already:

- Told Katie Hopkins that she looks like a handbag.
- Sent Gary Lineker an elaborate ascii drawing of a turd.
- Poked fun at Alan Sugar.
- Made a deeply personal remark to Emma Watson.
- Sent an obscene photograph to Sir Ian McKellen.
- Threatened to kidnap Katy Perry’s dog.

The satisfaction, let me tell you, was immense!

I foresee a bright future for Trollowing. I predict that this exciting new sport will take the world by storm and will soon be played in every home, school and office around the globe. It’s an engaging and fundamentally intellectual game that is far less harmful than sports such as rugby or chess. What’s more, it’s inclusive; Trollowing is a game that all the family can play and it warms my heart to think of parents and children gathered around the computer, all laughing as they tell Justin Bieber he’s a cunt.

Who will you ‘Trollow’? Why not let us know in the comments section below. Or better still, why not trollow us yourself? Direct your abuse to @the_circus_mag
