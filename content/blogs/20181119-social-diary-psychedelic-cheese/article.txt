The Circus, burbling turpidly along Agamemnon Street, chances a glimpse of its ambling form in a shop window. ‘A fine choice of animated tie!’ it thinks to itself, numbly pawing the glass. The tie shimmers alluringly in the autumn sunlight and The Circus stands mesmerised and agape.

A cautious thought skitters nudely across its consciousness: ‘Maybe this is the new psychedelic cheese that everyone’s talking about?’

The thought evaporates. The tie swirls and twists entrancingly. ‘Best damned tie Turnbull & Asser ever made me,’ thinks The Circus. ‘Why aren’t all ties like this tie? Why is the world so grey and dull? Why can’t everything be free and beautiful like this wondrous tie?’

Soon The Circus is running through St James’s Park, waving its arms in the air and shouting “Pornographic Rupert Bear Cartoons! Rap Music! Free Love!” as it rushes back to the office to start an underground magazine and tell the world of the wonders of fourth-dimensional neckwear.

The next day The Circus is found under its desk, devoid of trousers and sobbing over its now lifeless tie.
