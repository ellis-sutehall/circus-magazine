Little Rissington, November 25th

November gales have stripped oak and beech of their summer garb, revealing coal-black webs of root and limb. Summer sun has wrung the life from leaves that now gather in amber drifts beneath hedge and stile, offering welcome shelter for small mammals seeking a safe bed for the winter. Pickings for predators are scant: overturning bins and compost heaps, the hungry fox becomes ever bolder in his incursions into human territory.

Yet there are those to whom this iron season represents respite. Massing in their thousands, the starlings over Icomb wood form a shape-shifting aurora borealis of dark smoke. Who knows what bleaker Eastern climes they have left behind to winter on this dark hill? On the valley floor, the swollen stream has spilled in quicksilver splashes over the water meadows, as though to welcome the geese and ducks from their long journey south. Fields vacated by cattle and sheep now play host to the darting redwing and busy fieldfare.

It’s a rare winged migrant that escapes the eye of Keith Catchpole. A dedicated ‘twitcher’, Keth has spent thirty years studying the activities of our avian friends, and is one of the area’s leading experts on wildfowl. No summer sunrise is too early to find Keith at the fringe of a wood, in pursuit of the elusive chiff-chaff. And when rumours of waxwings circulate, no January blizzard is too bitter to keep Keith and his Nikon indoors.

With their khaki shorts and kagoules, Keith and his wife are almost as much a part of our Cotswold landscape as the hills themselves. Theirs is the true enthusiast’s passion, driven by a desire to share which extends far beyond their love of nature; and those in the know soon learn that when Keith slings his binoculars to the left, he has more on his mind than scoter or grebe.

It’s a short walk from the car park to the lakeside, but on a December night, the warmth of Keith’s Toyota wins out over the spaciousness of the bird hide. There’s no room inside for spectators, but the rest of us soon forget about the winter wind as Keith and Meg demonstrate that their knowledge of anatomy is hardly restricted to the avian kingdom. Meg’s luxuriant underbush provides the perfect habitat for Keith’s strutting cock, and soon the pair of them are banging like a woodpecker on a tree stump. It’s a thrilling display that gets us all twitching, and the Catchpoles will be cleaning more than guano from their bodywork tomorrow morning.
