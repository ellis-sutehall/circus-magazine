Little Rissington, June 10th

Skirting the coppice of beech and hazel, a stiff wade through knee-length grass is rewarded when I emerge into the last rays of the setting sun, almost tangible in the evening mist. Below me, the valley stretches away towards Burford, shadow-tinged with indigo and cyan. The coarse voices of the roosting rooks are cut by the screech of a tawny owl, burdened with hungry chicks and impatient to be abroad in the brief summer night.

Still soft from last night’s storms, the steaming path tells tales to those who can read nature’s words. Rabbit droppings lie strewn like piles of miniature cannonballs in a toy dockyard, while the tell-tale footprints of Mustela Nivalis emerge from the hedge, running skimper-skamper in and out of puddles for twenty yards and disappearing into a bank. A few clumps of bloodied fur testify to the fate of some poor kit at the weasel’s hands.

Dropping down from the stile, I descend along the sheep-track that traces a spur of the hill. Mostly conifers, the larger wood below me glowers thickly in the evening gloom. The fading cries of the rooks are supplanted by other noises: the insistent burble of the river, the humming of insects, and the crunch of wheels on Forestry Commission gravel. I wind slowly through larch and fir in pursuit of the purr of diesel engines and the soft glow of dipped headlights.

It’s a close-knit community, and no surprise to find familiar faces. Jim’s family have been farming the uplands for more than a century, and his wellies bear the mud of ages. Down at the garage, Darren’s oily hands have restored to life everything from Range Rovers to combine harvesters. Back from agricultural college for the summer, Sebastian is fresh-faced and hearty, as is his father the Duke; while Robin adopts the same friendly, approachable demeanour here that he displays in the classroom.

The Fiat Multipla may not be the prettiest vehicle in the world, but its large windows provide excellent lines of sight, especially as Darren has thoughtfully left them ajar to minimise misting. He introduces us to his friend Katja, all the way from Romania, and soon the people carrier’s firm suspension comes into its own. As the rocking motion builds, six left hands brace themselves against the bodywork, six heads jostle for the best viewing position, and the stream’s babble is joined by grunts and sighs. When Jim announces that he needs a helping hand, everyone’s all too ready to ‘muck in’, and soon the finest seeds of Little Rissington are being spent upon the stony ground.

As Darren scrubs at his customer’s upholstery with a Kleenex, I mark a clump of unusual foliage near an adjacent tree stump, adorned with bright daisy-like yellow flowers. An obscure introduction from continental Europe, Leopard’s Bane (Arnica Montana) is a rare find in these parts, and is said to have powerful medicinal properties. Its soft, heart-shaped green leaves also prove ideal for wiping jizz from the hem of my Barbour.
