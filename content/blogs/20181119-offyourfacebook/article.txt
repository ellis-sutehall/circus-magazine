Mark Zuckercorn, head of the popular information-harvesting website Facebook today announced the launch of a brand new social network for drunk people.

Zuckercorn, 32, unveiled Offyourfacebook to an audience of dead-eyed acolytes at the company’s California headquarters in the early hours of the morning.

The new social networking platform has been designed to be easy to use by the drunk, stoned or otherwise incapacitated, and is built around a simplified user interface that can be easily navigated by the inebriated, baked or bewildered.

“Offyourfacebook will allow drunk people around the world to connect with one another, even though they won’t remember a thing about it later,” said teen web-wizard Zuckercorn. “The custom ‘Pissed User Interface’ [PUI] will make base-level interaction possible on a global scale. You simply paw haphazardly at the screen until you find someone you blearily recognise and click the ‘You’re My Besht Mate’ button to make friends with them and away you go.”

Offyourfacebook has a number of built-in facilities to enable befuddled interaction with other users, including the ‘I Fuckin’ Love You’ button and the ‘One-click Genital Selfie Tool’. There are also preset functions for fighting and bragging to other users.
