Although not seen for centuries, Aslan is “on the move”, our sources can reveal.

According to a middle-aged beaver, who wishes to remain anonymous, “Aslan is on the move” and can shortly be expected to arrive from his country over the sea.

The White Witch, self-styled Queen of Narnia, is said to be unconcerned about the lion’s arrival, a diminutive aide claiming that his mistress “is not afraid of any cat, not matter how allegorical.”

Readers who encounter Aslan are advised to approach him with care, as he is, as our source reminds us “not a tame lion”.

See the weather page for information on how Aslan’s arrival is likely to affect the prevailing wintery conditions…
