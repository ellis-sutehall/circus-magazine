Many of the nation’s journalists, including your comrades at The Circus, are soon to go on strike in protest at the formulaic news stories they are expected to write.

The journalists’ main grievance is the convention which states that the first, brief paragraph must sum up the entire story in one sentence, for the benefit of readers who really can’t be bothered to wade through the whole article but feel guilty about only scanning the headlines. The expectation that the writer will then provide almost all the other salient points of the story in the second, longer paragraph is also felt to let lazy readers off too lightly and to hinder journalists in their attempt to tell the story in the best way they can; journalists generally feel that they could provide much better news coverage if they weren’t always writing to formula.

A strikers’ representative, speaking yesterday, informed The Circus that “Another problem we have is the way that, round about paragraph three, we always have to drag in quotes from some wanker with direct experience of the story, to make it look as though we’d actually bothered to do some serious reporting. To be honest, it’s normally cribbed from the press release or at best from a five minute phone interview – and anyway, does anyone actually care what these people say? Do they heck. It’s almost as transparent an attempt to fill space with credibility as that pathetic convention of interviewing a random member of public when we’ve run out of actual facts to relate. By what definition does the half-baked opinion of some cloddish passer-by constitute ‘News’? It’s a pathetic ruse, and we don’t want to do it any more.”

Members of the public, when asked what they thought, were fairly indifferent and had little of interest to say. Jack Smithson, a quantity surveyor based in London, summed up the general attitude when he said “Well, to be honest, I only ever really read the headlines – and maybe the first couple of paragraphs if people are particularly likely to be discussing a story at work – so I can’t really claim to know what they’re talking about. But still, if it improves the quality of journalism in this country then good luck to them, I guess.”

Despite being faced with such apathy, the strikers are determined to press on and are bullish regarding their chances of success. Their representative said that, if nothing else, “We at least want a written guarantee that we’ll never again be asked to return to the opinions of a previously-interviewed expert in the final paragraph, just to wrap up the story with an element of human authenticity and make it look like we care. It’s horribly clichéd, it makes me squirm every time I see it, and it simply has to stop.”
