They said it would never happen, but ’80s pop has-beens Wham! have announced that they will reform for a series of concerts and a life or death battle with a giant cormorant.

George Michael and Andrew Ridgeley told the press that they have put their differences aside and will reunite to fight the giant cormorant that has terrified shipping in the Thames Estuary since March.

“It’s not about the money,” explained Ridgeley, “it’s about showing this giant cormorant who’s boss.”

“This hasn’t been an easy decision for us,” added Michael, “but it seems that if Wham! don’t do something about this giant cormorant then nobody else is going to.”

When asked what their strategy was for dealing with the cormorant, Ridgeley replied, “obviously we don’t want to give too much away at this point, but we’ll try reasoning with it to start with.”

“If that doesn’t work, we’ll have to use force,” added Michael darkly.

The duo, whose hits include ‘Gold’ and ‘Do They Know It’s Christmas?’, went on to explain that when they’ve killed the cormorant they will ride its carcass back to London where they will perform a series of celebratory concerts at the O2 Arena.

We spoke to Justin Probably of the RSPB to see what chances he thought Wham! had: “Well, Wham! are in their fifties now and this cormorant’s over 200 feet long. Maybe in their heyday they could have taken it, but now… Well it’s a longshot.”
