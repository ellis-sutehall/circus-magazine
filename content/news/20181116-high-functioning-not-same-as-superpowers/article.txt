The British Medical Association is to stop prefixing mild forms of medical conditions with the words “high functioning”, because of a commonly held belief that the term implies superhuman abilities. The move comes amid reports that there has been a surge in the number of adults requesting another MMR vaccine so that they can “be like Spiderman”.

BMA spokesperson Sandra McReevie told The Circus that the Diagnostic & Statistic Manual of Mental Disorders was to be changed immediately, citing concerns that support groups for high-functioning alcoholics had become inundated with sufferers believing that cans of lager would endow them with phenomenal strength, “like Popeye with spinach”.

“The aspirational nature of ‘high-functioning’ diagnoses is not helpful, and the BMA must urgently distance itself from any association with the X-Men,” said McReevie, adding: “We hope that, through the updated DSM, we will be able to dispel once and for all the myths that high-functioning sociopaths, for example, ‘see’ clues like Sherlock Holmes, or that children with high-functioning autism ‘level up’ every time they complete a Rubik’s cube. Also, we are keen to counter the belief that autistic people are telepathic. They cannot read people’s minds, and even if they could they wouldn’t be able to understand them.”
