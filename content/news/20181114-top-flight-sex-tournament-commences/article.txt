For many the highlight of the sporting calendar, the All England Lawn Sex Championships got under way in Wimbledon, South London yesterday.

The contest, which is considered the grand prix of competitive sex, has been held at the All England Lawn Sex Club in Wimbledon since 1877 and attracts some 400,000 spectators annually. This year’s Grand Slam will see some 1400 competitors from all over the world face off in events such as Gentlemen’s and Ladies’ Singles, Doubles and the infamous and often deadly Mixed Doubles.

For the next fortnight, while spectators consume an estimated 14 million tons of strawberries and cream, the competitors will grunt, fondle, finger and fornicate through the gruelling heats as they compete to be crowned the All England Lawn Sex Champion. Those entering the knockout stage will sweat, suck and squeal and generally shag one another beyond the limits of human endurance in their relentless, grinding pursuit of glory.

Competitive sex is a contact sport and injuries are common. Almost two fifths of the competitors are expected to require hospital treatment as a result of injuries ranging from grass burns to a dislocated pelvis. Ambulances will be standing by ready to ferry their groaning loads to the nearest A&E or Genito Urinary department.

The risks are high but, with prize money of up to £300 the rewards are immense. And could this be the first year that a British player wins the tournament after a disappointing 78 years of failure? Fans certainly think so, with hopes being pinned on Scottish favourite Greg MacDonald. Whatever happens, Wimbledon as always promises to be a thrilling fortnight of world-class competitive sex!

For those unable to attend the tournament, the BBC are offering extensive live coverage fronted by Lawn Sex expert Claire Balding.
