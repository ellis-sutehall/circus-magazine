RAF hero and fighter ace James ‘Biggles’ Bigglesworth, who fought in both world wars, has been given a posthumous royal pardon.

It addresses his 1952 conviction for gross indecency. He had been arrested after having an affair with his co-pilot Algernon ‘Algy’ Lacey. The conviction meant he lost his security clearance and had to resign from the RAF, for whom he had served in two world wars.

The pardon was granted under the Royal Prerogative of Mercy after a request by Justice Minister Chris Grayling.

“Squadron Leader James Bigglesworth was an exceptional man and a brilliant pilot,” said Mr Grayling.

He said that Biggles’ innumerable victories in the air against the dastardly hun undoubtedly shortened both world wars and saved thousands of lives.

“His later life was overshadowed by his conviction for homosexual activity, a sentence we would now consider unjust and discriminatory and which has now been repealed,” said Mr Grayling.

“Biggles deserves to be remembered and recognised for his fantastic contribution to the war effort and his legacy to aviation. A pardon from the Queen is a fitting tribute to an exceptional man.”

Grayling went on to say that although he was prepared to pardon the occasional computer scientist or fictional war hero for PR reasons, anybody else hoping for a royal pardon could go jump.
