The financial uncertainty in Britain reached a new low today, with authorities reporting that the country has now completely run out of the numbers one to six.

British ministers appealed to Europe for help, stating that the dearth of lower numbers would not only negatively affect the country’s fragile economic recovery but also have a knock-on effect on the availability of numbers immediately above six, as citizens forced to buy consumer goods in quantities of seven or more unwittingly bring about a run on the lowest numbers still available.

“It’s like a scene from the third world,” said a London shopkeeper. “We’ve been besieged with panicked customers desperately trying to buy as few items as possible, before the shortage expands and they’re forced to buy in greater quantities. There’ve been queues round the block of people who’re determined not to have to carry home more than seven of the same item and, although we’re trying to talk people into bulk-buying where possible, we can’t force them to do it and it won’t be long before we’re completely out of the number seven and it starts being multiples of eight or nothing.”

An emergency meeting was called last night at Downing Street to discuss ways of handling the situation. The fear is that, as desperate shoppers continue to buy in the increasingly large smallest-possible quantities, the larger single-digit numbers, which are less popular and of which smaller reserves are usually kept, will disappear completely by the end of the week. There are even concerns that the number ten itself could run out if the situation is not appropriately managed, which would immediately lead to the collapse of the decimal currency.

David Cameron today flew to Brussels to ask Europe for a crisis loan of one-billion small numbers, to be delivered in small, sealed instalments in order to avoid accidental addition into larger numbers which could make matters worse. He has also asked w for an emergency division to be dispatched to Britain, to split the larger numbers present in excess into smaller numbers suitable for day-to-day transactions. The Prime Minister pleaded with Europe to grant his request, saying this was the only way to defuse the crisis while a longer-term solution is sought, but was met with hostility and, indeed, perplexity. “This is the most innumerate request we have ever received,” said a baffled European Commissioner. “How can a man claim to have seven of something and yet not to have seven-times-one of them? The whole country has clearly gone mad.”
