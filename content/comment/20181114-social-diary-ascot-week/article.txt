The Circus struggling once again into its piss-stained morning trousers can only mean one thing — it is Ascot week.

It is not just a business occasion — although The Circus hopes to win enough to see it through to Cripps week — but also a social one; a time to catch up with old friends, see some familiar faces and to renew a few grudges.

Arriving one spat too few at Ascot station, The Circus is in fine spirits, buoyed, no doubt, by the four cans of excellent Polish lager it consumed on the train. Strolling around the Royal Enclosure, The Circus is enjoying itself top hole. ‘This’, it thinks to itself ‘is surely what it means to be English. Staggering round, drunk as all hell, trying not to be sick on anyone with the initials HRH before their name. Marvellous.’

The Circus spies some friends having a drink and decides to do join them. They too have betting to do, but there’s time for another and perhaps one more. The Circus starts to feel as though it is on a carousel; horses and sick everywhere, bright colours, spinning faster and faster… Soon all is a blur.

The last thing The Circus remembers is Princess Anne’s face lurching horrifically towards its own. The next morning it found itself in one of those great big bins behind the catering tents. Damned hard things to get out of, those bins.
