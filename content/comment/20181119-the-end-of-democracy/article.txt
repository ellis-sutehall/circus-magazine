The leader of the UK Independence Party, Nigel Farage, has unveiled ambitious new plans for reform. In their election manifesto, UKIP claim to have identified the key flaws in the European project, and the constitutional remedies necessary to avoid them. “We are committed to withdrawing from the European Union,” explained Farage, “but we can also learn lessons from events on the Continent. What has happened in Greece, in particular, is too important to ignore.

“What we see in Athens right now is the last stage in a historical cycle. It begins with rule by a benevolent aristocracy. It slides into oligarchy, the rule of the rich. Then comes democracy, leading inevitably to the final act: the rise of a populist demagogue and the slide into tyrrany.”

The reforms proposed by Mr Farage are intended to prevent the same from happening in the UK. Instead of being chosen at the ballot box, rulers would be identified from infancy and specially trained for their roles. “We live in an age of unparalleled disaffection and cyncism, in which politics and politicians are rightly held in contempt,” said the UKIP leader. “This shows us that democracy amounts to nothing more than rule by the mob. The obvious alternative — the only alternative — is to create a race of disinterested leaders through an arduous programme of physical and mental education.

“Government by the politicians has failed. Government by the businessmen has failed. What we call for is government by the philosophers.”

Mr Farage is known to admire the Spartan system of government, and has criticised EU “nanny state” legislation which prevents newborn babies being left on the sides of mountains. In his speech addressed to his companions Glaucon, Cephalus, Polemarchus and Thrasymachus, he set out an ambitious timetable for the first two years of a UKIP government. Withdrawal from the Maastricht Treaty would be followed within twelve months by the abolition of personal property, music and the visual arts. The institution of marriage would be replaced by a eugenicist programme in which compatible men and women are chosen anonymously for procreation. The offspring of these couplings are to be raised communally, with no child permitted to know who his or her parents are.

At the same time, an overhaul to UKIP’s defence policy will see the armed forces merged into a single warrior caste, of which membership will be largely hereditary. It is from the ranks of the warriors that Mr Farage’s “philosopher-kings” will be chosen.

“There will be no end to the troubles of states,” concluded Mr Farage, “or indeed, my dear Glaucon, of humanity itself, till philosophers become rulers in this world, or till those we now call kings and rulers really and truly become philosophers, and political power and philosophy thus come into the same hands.”

David Cameron and Ed Miliband were quick to condemn UKIP’s plans as “unworkable” and “absurd”, while the Liberal Democrats are understood to be willing to enable pretty much anything if the price is right.
